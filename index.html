            <p>Now that there is the Tec-9, a crappy spray gun from South Miami. This gun is advertised as the most popular gun in American crime. Do you believe that shit? It actually says that in the little book that comes with it: the most popular gun in American crime. Like they're actually proud of that shit.</p>

            <p>Do you see any Teletubbies in here? Do you see a slender plastic tag clipped to my shirt with my name printed on it? Do you see a little Asian child with a blank expression on his face sitting outside on a mechanical helicopter that shakes when you put quarters in it? That's what you see at a toy store.</p>
            <h3>Your bones don't break, mine do</h3>

            <h3>The Trouble with Tribbles is</h3>
            <p>
            The game's not big enough unless it scares you a little. I think you've let your personal feelings cloud your judgement. We know you're dealing in stolen ore. But I wanna talk about the assassination attempt on Lieutenant Worf. The look in your eyes, I recognize it. You used to have it for me. I am your worst nightmare! Talk about going nowhere fast. Mr. Worf, you do remember how to fire phasers? Wait a minute - you've been declared dead. You can't give orders around here. 
            </p>
            <h3>And back in Parramatta</h3>
