Ridolfi's New Web Page
-------------------------------
** Mark Addinall - August 2014 **

This web page is put together using my new FLUID and RESPONSIVE toolset specifically designed to produce "one-page", lightweight webby stuff for fondleslabs, phones and lappies.

Seems to work OK.  The LOOK-N-FEEL now has completely evolved to be PURE CSS.  Not a bit of markup anywhere else.
