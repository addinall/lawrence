/*
 * My newest development toolset "LOOK-n-FEEL is now 100% CSS3.
 * I have been aiming at a 'pure CSS' environment for over a decade,
 * but didn't have the tools, time or skill to bring it to fruition.
 *
 * We are going to use CSS as it SHOULD be.  We will have a minimalistic
 * CSS set of attributes that is built along with the boilerplate
 * RESPONSIVE and FLUID toolkit, and then we CASCADE our changes onto
 * it per customes.
 *
 * Indeed, I have been one of those souls who have started out with
 * an empty CSS file per project.
 *
 * August 2014 -  30 years of full time coding!  Time flies when
 * you're chasing BUGS!  ;-)
